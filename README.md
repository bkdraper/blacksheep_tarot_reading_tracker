# Tarot Reading Tracker

## Overview
A mobile-optimized single page application for tracking tarot readings and tips during events or sessions. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no external libraries or frameworks.

## Purpose
- Track individual tarot readings with timestamps
- Record tips for each reading
- Calculate totals (base earnings + tips)
- Manage readings log with add/remove functionality

## Technical Requirements
- **Pure web technologies**: HTML/CSS/JS only, no libraries
- **Mobile-first**: Optimized for mobile browsers and touch interfaces
- **Offline capable**: Works without internet connection
- **Single file**: Self-contained HTML file for easy deployment

## Design Rules Established

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch targets minimum 44px height for easy tapping
- Font sizes 16px+ to prevent mobile zoom
- System fonts for better mobile performance
- `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom
- `-webkit-appearance: none` to override mobile browser defaults
- Use `!important` declarations when mobile browsers override styles

### Layout Principles
- Compact design to maximize screen real estate
- Inline layouts for infrequently changed inputs (reading price)
- Table layouts for data that needs alignment (totals)
- Prominent display of most important information (grand total)

### User Experience
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete readings)
- Specific confirmation messages showing what's being deleted
- Auto-numbering of readings (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- Enter key handling for quick tip input
- Time-only timestamps (no seconds) for cleaner display

### Input Sizing
- Reading price: 80px width (rarely changes)
- Tip inputs: 70px width (frequent use, sized for 4-5 characters)
- All inputs center-aligned for better readability

## Features
